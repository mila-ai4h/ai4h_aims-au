# AIMS.au: A Dataset for the Analysis of Modern Slavery Countermeasures in Corporate Statements  
*Appearing in ICLR 2025*  

---

## Overview  

We introduce **AIMS.au**, a publicly available dataset designed to support the analysis of modern slavery statements from Australian-based organizations. This dataset, released under the **CC-BY license**, aims to enhance the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting requirements.  

ðŸ”— This paper is part of a larger initiative, [**Project AIMS (AI Against Modern Slavery)**](https://mila.quebec/en/ai4humanity/applied-projects/ai-against-modern-slavery-aims).

This research was developed by Mila - Quebec AI Institute in collaboration with The Queensland University of Technology.

### Key Features  
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Over **5,700** modern slavery statements sourced from the [**Australian Modern Slavery Register**](https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/).  
- **Detailed Annotations**: Sentence-level labels assigned by human annotators and domain experts. Basic reporting criteria, such as approval, signature, and identification of the reporting entity, were single-annotated. In contrast, more complex reporting criteria, requiring nuanced interpretation and greater scrutiny, were double-annotated for a subset of 4,657 statements.  
- **Gold Standard Subsets**: Two expert-annotated subsets, each containing **50** unique statements, designed to ensure high-reliability evaluations.  
- **Extensive Sentence-Level Data**: More than **800,000** labeled sentences covering **7,270** Australian entities from **2019 to 2023**.  

### Data Structure  
The dataset consists of three primary annotation levels:  
1. **Annotated dataset** â€“ Suitable for **model training**.  
2. **Gold subset (single expert validation)** â€“ Recommended for **model validation**.  
3. **Gold subset (triple-expert consensus)** â€“ Reserved for **model testing**, ensuring the highest trust in model performance assessments.

By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to advance research in automated compliance verification, offering a valuable resource for developing tools that assist human experts in assessing corporate transparency and accountability.  

To our knowledge, **AIMS.au** is the most extensive open source dataset with detailed annotations explicitly aligned with the **mandatory criteria** of the Australian **Modern Slavery Act (MSA)**.

## Dataset Documentation  

The following image illustrates the **correspondence between the AU MSA mandatory criteria** and the **questions designed for annotation** within the **AIMS.au** dataset. It also includes **fictitious examples** of disclosures that could appear in real corporate statements.

## Experiments  

The code to reproduce our experimental results is available in the [`code`](code) directory.  

### Models Evaluated  
We conducted experiments using a range of **open-source and closed-source language models**, including:  

- **Open-source models**:  
  - **DistilBERT** 
  - **BERT** 
  - **LLaMA 2 (7B)** 
  - **LLaMA 3.2 (3B)**

- **Closed-source models**:  
  - **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**  
  - **OpenAI GPT-4o**

These models were evaluated based on their ability to assess corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting standardsâ€”full details in the paper.

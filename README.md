## Overview  

We introduce **AIMS.au**, a publicly available dataset designed to support the analysis of modern slavery statements from Australian-based organizations. This dataset, released under the **CC-BY license**, aims to enhance the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting requirements.  

### Key Features  
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Over **5,700** modern slavery statements sourced from the **Australian Modern Slavery Register**.  
- **Detailed Annotations**: Sentence-level labels assigned by human annotators and domain experts.  
- **Rigorous Evaluation**: A total of **5,670** statements were reviewed by annotators to assess compliance with three fundamental reporting criteria outlined in the Australian Modern Slavery Act (MSA).  
- **Gold Standard Subsets**: Two expert-annotated subsets, each containing **50** unique statements, designed to ensure high-reliability evaluations.  
- **Extensive Sentence-Level Data**: More than **800,000** labeled sentences covering **7,270** Australian entities from **2019 to 2023**.  

### Data Structure  
The dataset consists of three primary annotation levels:  
1. **Hired annotators' labels** â€“ Suitable for **model training**.  
2. **Gold subset (single expert validation)** â€“ Recommended for **model validation**.  
3. **Gold subset (triple-expert consensus)** â€“ Reserved for **model testing**, ensuring the highest trust in model performance assessments.  

By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to advance research in automated compliance verification, offering a valuable resource for developing tools that assist human experts in assessing corporate transparency and accountability.  

To our knowledge, **AIMS.au** is the first and most extensive dataset with detailed annotations explicitly aligned with the **mandatory criteria** of the Australian **Modern Slavery Act (MSA)**.

## Dataset Documentation  

The following image illustrates the **correspondence between the AU MSA mandatory criteria** and the **questions designed for annotation** within the **AIMS.au** dataset. It also includes **fictitious examples** of disclosures that could appear in real corporate statements.

## Experiments  

The code to reproduce our experimental results is available in the [`code`](code) directory.  

### Models Evaluated  
We conducted experiments using a range of **open-source and closed-source language models**, including:  
- **Open-source models**:  
  - DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2020)  
  - BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)  
  - Llama2 (7B) (Touvron et al., 2023)  
  - Llama3.2 (3B) (Dubey et al., 2024)  
- **Closed-source models**:  
  - OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo  
  - OpenAI GPT-4o  

These models were evaluated based on their ability to assess corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting standards.

# AIMS.au: A Dataset for the Analysis of Modern Slavery Countermeasures in Corporate Statements  
*Appearing in ICLR 2025*  

---

## Overview  

We introduce **AIMS.au**, a publicly available dataset designed to support the analysis of modern slavery statements from Australian-based organizations. This dataset, released under the **CC-BY license**, aims to enhance the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting requirements.  

This paper is part of a larger initiative, **Project AIMS (AI Against Modern Slavery)**.

### Key Features  
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Over **5,700** modern slavery statements sourced from the **Australian Modern Slavery Register**(https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/).  
- **Detailed Annotations**: Sentence-level labels assigned by human annotators and domain experts. Basic reporting criteria, such as approval, signature, and identification of the reporting entity, were single-annotated. In contrast, more complex reporting criteria, requiring nuanced interpretation and greater scrutiny, were double-annotated for a subset of 4,657 statements.  
- **Gold Standard Subsets**: Two expert-annotated subsets, each containing **50** unique statements, designed to ensure high-reliability evaluations.  
- **Extensive Sentence-Level Data**: More than **800,000** labeled sentences covering **7,270** Australian entities from **2019 to 2023**.  

### Data Structure  
The dataset consists of three primary annotation levels:  
1. **Annotated dataset** â€“ Suitable for **model training**.  
2. **Gold subset (single expert validation)** â€“ Recommended for **model validation**.  
3. **Gold subset (triple-expert consensus)** â€“ Reserved for **model testing**, ensuring the highest trust in model performance assessments.

By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to advance research in automated compliance verification, offering a valuable resource for developing tools that assist human experts in assessing corporate transparency and accountability.  

To our knowledge, **AIMS.au** is the most extensive open source dataset with detailed annotations explicitly aligned with the **mandatory criteria** of the Australian **Modern Slavery Act (MSA)**.

## Dataset Documentation  

The following image illustrates the **correspondence between the AU MSA mandatory criteria** and the **questions designed for annotation** within the **AIMS.au** dataset. It also includes **fictitious examples** of disclosures that could appear in real corporate statements.

## Experiments

### Models Evaluated  
We conducted experiments using a range of **open-source and closed-source language models**, including:  

- **Open-source models**:  
  - **DistilBERT** [(Sanh et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)  
  - **BERT** [(Devlin et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)  
  - **LLaMA 2 (7B)** [(Touvron et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)  
  - **LLaMA 3.2 (3B)** [(Dubey et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345) *(Update with correct citation when available)*  

- **Closed-source models**:  
  - **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**  
  - **OpenAI GPT-4o** [(OpenAI, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) *(Citing GPT-4 report, update for GPT-4o when available)*  

These models were evaluated based on their ability to assess corporate compliance with modern slavery reporting standards.
